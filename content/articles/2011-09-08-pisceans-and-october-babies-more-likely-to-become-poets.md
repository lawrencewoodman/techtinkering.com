This is the second in a series of articles looking into whether when you were born affects your future.  In the previous article I looked at [Nobel laureates](/2011/08/24/does-when-you-were-born-affect-your-chance-of-becoming-a-nobel-laureate), which are, of course, from a range of fields.  Now it is time to focus on just one discipline with poets.  I have again used [ScraperWiki](http://scraperwiki.com) to scrape [wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org).  This time using its [list of poets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poets) and extracting each person's _Date of Birth_.

## The Findings

The dates of birth were collated and from this frequency charts were constructed for the months of birth and star signs of the poets.  The findings are illustrated below.

### Distribution of Months of Birth Among Poets
<img src="/img/articles/poets_mob.png" title="Distribution of Months of Birth Among Poets"/>

There is not too much difference here between the months, although October and June do stand out as having more poets or less poets respectively.  The difference between October and June is `2.99%`.  This is interesting as the result for poets born in June is the inverse of the result for Nobel laureates born in June, where they were most likely to become a Nobel laureate.

<table class="neatTable" style="clear: left;">
  <tr><th>Month of Birth</th><th>Frequency</th><th>Percent</th></tr>
  <tr><td>January</td><td>44</td><td>8.21</td></tr>
  <tr><td>February</td><td>46</td><td>8.58</td></tr>
  <tr><td>March</td><td>49</td><td>9.14</td></tr>
  <tr><td>April</td><td>40</td><td>7.46</td></tr>
  <tr><td>May</td><td>42</td><td>7.84</td></tr>
  <tr><td>June</td><td>37</td><td>6.90</td></tr>
  <tr><td>July</td><td>47</td><td>8.77</td></tr>
  <tr><td>August</td><td>46</td><td>8.58</td></tr>
  <tr><td>September</td><td>45</td><td>8.40</td></tr>
  <tr><td>October</td><td>53</td><td>9.89</td></tr>
  <tr><td>November</td><td>44</td><td>8.21</td></tr>
  <tr><td>December</td><td>43</td><td>8.02</td></tr>
</table>

**Sample Size:** 536

### Distribution of Star Signs Among Poets
<img src="/img/articles/poets_star_sign.png" title="Distribution of Star Signs Among Poets"/>

As with Nobel laureates the difference in distribution of star signs among poets seems to be much greater then the distribution of the months in which they were born.  We can see from the graph that Pisceans are more likely to be poets than Geminis and Taureans.  However, if you look more closely at Pisces at the top and Gemini at the bottom, you will find that while the difference is `2.8%`, this is actually less than the difference between highest and lowest for months of birth.

<table class="neatTable" style="clear: left;">
  <tr><th>Star Sign</th><th>Frequency</th><th>Percent</th><th>Dates</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Aries</td><td>44</td><td>8.21</td><td>21 March - 19 April</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Taurus</td><td>39</td><td>7.28</td><td>20 April - 20 May</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Gemini</td><td>38</td><td>7.09</td><td>21 May - 20 June</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Cancer</td><td>44</td><td>8.21</td><td>21 June - 22 July</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Leo</td><td>47</td><td>8.77</td><td>23 July - 22 August</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Virgo</td><td>51</td><td>9.51</td><td>23 August - 22 September</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Libra</td><td>49</td><td>9.14</td><td>23 September - 22 October</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Scorpio</td><td>43</td><td>8.02</td><td>23 October - 21 November</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Sagittarius</td><td>44</td><td>8.21</td><td>22 November - 21 December</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Capricorn</td><td>42</td><td>7.84</td><td>22 December - 19 January</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Aquarius</td><td>42</td><td>7.84</td><td>20 January - 18 February</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Pisces</td><td>53</td><td>9.89</td><td>19 February - 20 March</td></tr>
</table>

## Problems With The Study
The problems with this study are similar to those for the article about
Nobel laureates.

* The distribution of months of birth and star signs could just represent the normal
  distribution for that population and therefore should be compared to non
  prize winners.
* Quite a few of the poets didn't have an accurate date of birth, and were therefore
  excluded.
* The sample size is relatively small.

## Conclusion
Unlike Nobel laureates the distribution of birth periods among poets seems to be about the same for star signs and months of birth.  It seems that if your are a Piscean or born in October then you are more likely to be a poet and if you are a Gemini or born in June then you are less likely.

## Scrapers and Views
I have given examples of the code used to scrape Wikipedia in the previous article.  For this article I will just reference the scrapers and provide code for one of the views instead.
