# .RLE Image Files

The images in this directory were contained within the file, [rdump10.lbr](http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/cpm/graphics/rdump10.lbr), on the [Walnut Creek CD](http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/ftp.php?b=cpm/Software/WalnutCD/).  This file can be found in the following location on the CD:
* [/cpm/graphics/](http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/ftp.php?b=cpm%2FSoftware%2FWalnutCD%2Fcpm%2Fgraphics).

The .RLE files were converted to .PBM files using _cistopbm_ and then converted to .PNG using _gThumb_.

The copyright remains with the original owners and I make no claim to them.  They are contained here as they have been freely available via the Walnut Creek CD for over 20 years.
