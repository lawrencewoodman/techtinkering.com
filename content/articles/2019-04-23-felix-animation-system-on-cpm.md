In 1979 the University of Tennessee/Knoxville's Computer Science Department released [Felix v2.1](http://cpmarchives.classiccmp.org/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/simtel/cpmug/cpmug035.ark "cpmug035.ark (Felix v2.1) from the Walnut Creek CD: /simtel/cpmug/") for CP/M, which is available on the Walnut Creek CD.  It aimed to provide a basis for computer animation experiments and projects for education and hobbyist use.

The system used an early graphics card for S-100 bus computers called the [Cromemco Dazzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromemco_Dazzler) to display the animations on a television screen.  The Dazzler was released in 1976 and could display a maximum resolution of 128x128 in monochrome or 64x64 using 8 colours with or without intensity.

Felix uses a VM to display and control the animations with the hope of creating a portable animation system across computing platforms.  The animations are created in a form of assembly language targeted at the Felix VM which is assembled using the `FASM` command to produce a `.FEX` file which is then run using the `EXEC` command.

An example file called `BEE.FAS` is included in the archive and listed below:

You can see a couple of animations using Felix in the following video.  It demonstrates Felix using [z80pack](/articles/emulating-a-cpm-system-with-z80pack/) to emulate an IMSAI 8080 with a Dazzler, running CP/M 2.2.  Unfortunately, I'm not able to fully test Felix because the emulator doesn't emulate the required analog-to-digital converter to use the joysticks.  However, it was fun to play with and I think it's nice to see the system in action.
